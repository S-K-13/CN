take two pcs
e one switch 2950-24take one server server-pt

click on server
go to desktop
click ip config
enter ipv4 address as 192.168.1.1
enter dns server same as 192.168.1.1
enter default gateway 192.168.1.2

click services 
open dhcp 
turn it on 
enter the same default gateway 192.168.1.2 and dns server 192.168.1.1
click on save
close window

open pc1
go to desktop 
open ipconfig
click on dhcp 
def gateway and dns server must show the same as server
ipv4 address must show 
192.168.1.3
do the same for pc 2

check connection using ping command in command prompt and by sending pdu 

done!!!

Title: Installing and Configuring DHCP Server and Assigning IP Addresses to Client Machines using DHCP Server  

• Problem Statement:
  – To install, configure, and verify a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network parameters to client systems on a network.

• Aim:
  – To understand the working of the DHCP protocol and learn how to configure a DHCP server to provide automatic IP addressing to clients.

• Concept Description:

  1. **What is DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)?**
     – DHCP is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS information to client devices on a network.
     – It eliminates the need for manual IP configuration on every device.
     – DHCP operates at the **Application Layer** of the OSI model and uses **UDP ports 67 (server)** and **68 (client)**.
     – It follows a **client–server model**, where:
       • DHCP Server: Assigns IP addresses and configuration data.
       • DHCP Client: Requests IP and network parameters.
     – DHCP simplifies network management and prevents IP conflicts.

  2. **Working Process of DHCP (DORA Process):**
     The DHCP process involves four main steps known as **DORA**:
     - **D (Discover):** The client sends a DHCP Discover broadcast message to find available DHCP servers.
     - **O (Offer):** The DHCP server replies with an Offer containing an available IP address and configuration.
     - **R (Request):** The client requests the offered IP address by sending a DHCP Request message.
     - **A (Acknowledge):** The server acknowledges the request and assigns the IP address to the client.

     After this exchange, the client can use the assigned IP address to communicate on the network.

  3. **Why DHCP is Needed:**
     – Manually configuring IP addresses for every system in a large network is time-consuming and error-prone.
     – DHCP automates IP management, reduces configuration mistakes, and ensures efficient address utilization.
     – It dynamically reassigns addresses when clients leave or join the network.

  4. **Advantages of DHCP:**
     – Automatic IP configuration for all clients.
     – Avoids IP duplication and conflicts.
     – Simplifies network administration.
     – Supports scalability for large networks.
     – Enables centralized IP management.

• Steps to Install and Configure DHCP Server (Windows Server 2003 Example):

  **A. Installing DHCP Service:**
  1. Click **Start → Control Panel → Add or Remove Programs**.
  2. Select **Add/Remove Windows Components**.
  3. In the Windows Components Wizard, select **Networking Services**, then click **Details**.
  4. Check the box for **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** and click **OK**.
  5. Click **Next** to start the setup process.
  6. Insert the Windows Server CD if prompted; installation files will be copied.
  7. Click **Finish** when the installation completes.

  **B. Configuring the DHCP Service:**
  1. Open **Administrative Tools → DHCP**.
  2. In the DHCP console, right-click the server name and select **New Scope**.
  3. The **New Scope Wizard** will open – follow these steps:
     - Enter a descriptive name for the scope (e.g., “Office Network”).
     - Specify the IP range to be leased (e.g., 192.168.100.1 – 192.168.100.100).
     - Define the **Subnet Mask** (e.g., 255.255.255.0).
     - Exclude any static IP addresses already in use (e.g., servers, routers).
     - Set the **Lease Duration** (how long a client can use an IP before renewal).
     - Add the **Default Gateway (Router IP)** (e.g., 192.168.100.1).
     - Configure **DNS server IP** (e.g., 8.8.8.8 or internal DNS IP).
     - Optionally, configure **WINS server** if applicable.
     - Activate the scope to allow DHCP clients to receive IPs.
  4. Click **Finish** to complete scope creation.
  5. Authorize the DHCP server in **Active Directory** (if required) to prevent unauthorized servers.

  **C. Verification:**
  – On a client machine, open the **Command Prompt** and type:
    ```
    ipconfig /release
    ipconfig /renew
    ```
    – The client should now receive an IP address from the DHCP server automatically.

• Example Configuration (Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation):
  – Create a simple topology with one **Server**, one **Switch**, and multiple **Client PCs**.
  – On the server:
    • Enable DHCP service.
    • Define a pool name, default gateway, DNS, starting and ending IP.
  – On each client PC:
    • Go to Desktop → IP Configuration → Select “DHCP”.
    • The system will automatically receive an IP address from the defined range.

• Output:
  – Each client machine automatically received an IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS.
  – The DHCP server successfully managed IP address allocation without manual configuration.

• Concept Used:
  – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
  – IP Address Leasing and Renewal
  – DHCP Scope, Lease Time, and Authorization
  – DORA process (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge)

• Outcome:
  – Successfully installed, configured, and verified a DHCP server.
  – Understood how DHCP simplifies IP address management in large networks.

• Conclusion:
  – The DHCP server automatically assigned IP addresses and network parameters to all connected clients, proving effective for centralized and automated network management.
