Assignment No: 12  
Title: Write a Program for DNS Lookup  

• Problem Statement:
  – Write a program for DNS lookup. Given an IP address input, it should return the corresponding URL and vice versa.

• Objective:
  – To understand the concept of Domain Name System (DNS).
  – To perform mapping between host names and IP addresses (both ways).
  – To learn how DNS resolves domain names into IP addresses and vice versa.

• Tools/Software Used:
  – Programming Language: C / Java / Python (depending on lab setup)
  – Network connection for DNS queries

• Concept Description:

  1. **Need for DNS:**
     – Every computer on the internet is identified by a unique IP address (like 142.250.190.78).
     – Humans, however, find it easier to remember names like “www.google.com”.
     – DNS (Domain Name System) provides a service to map human-readable names (domain names) into IP addresses and vice versa.
     – Without DNS, users would need to remember long numeric IP addresses to access websites.

  2. **Basic Idea:**
     – DNS acts like a phonebook of the internet.
     – When you enter a website URL, your computer asks a DNS server to resolve it to the correct IP address.
     – The reverse process (IP to domain name) is called **Reverse DNS Lookup**.

  3. **How DNS Works:**
     – The DNS system is hierarchical and distributed.
     – It consists of different types of servers:
       • **Root DNS Servers** – Direct queries to the appropriate Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers (.com, .org, .in, etc.)
       • **TLD Servers** – Store addresses of authoritative DNS servers for each domain.
       • **Authoritative DNS Servers** – Contain the actual mapping between domain names and IP addresses.
     – Example Flow:
       1. The user enters “www.example.com”.
       2. The browser sends a request to the DNS resolver (usually your ISP).
       3. The resolver queries the root server → then the TLD → then the authoritative server.
       4. The IP address of “www.example.com” is returned.
       5. The resolver caches the result for faster future access.

  4. **Name Space:**
     – The set of all possible names used in the Internet.
     – Each name is mapped to a unique IP address.
     – Can be organized as:
       • **Flat Name Space:** All names are unique globally, stored in a single file (not scalable).
       • **Hierarchical Name Space:** Uses a tree structure for better organization and scalability.

  5. **Domain Name Space:**
     – Structured as an inverted tree with the **root (.)** at the top.
     – Each node or branch represents a domain.
     – Top-Level Domains (TLDs) include:
       • Generic: .com, .org, .edu, .net
       • Country: .in, .us, .uk, .jp

  6. **Label and Domain:**
     – Each node in the DNS tree has a label (max 63 characters).
     – A full domain name is a series of labels separated by dots.
     – Example: “mail.yahoo.com.” (ends with a dot representing the root).

  7. **Resolution Process:**
     – **Name-to-Address Mapping:**
       • Converts domain name to IP.
       • Example: “www.google.com” → “142.250.190.78”
     – **Address-to-Name Mapping (Reverse DNS):**
       • Converts IP address to domain name.
       • Example: “142.250.190.78” → “www.google.com”
     – Uses a **Resolver** and **Name Server**.
       • Resolver: DNS client on your system.
       • Name Server: Responds to queries and provides IP mappings.

  8. **Types of DNS Queries:**
     – **Recursive Query:** Resolver asks the DNS server for a complete answer.
     – **Iterative Query:** Server responds with a referral to another DNS server.
     – **Inverse Query (PTR):** Converts IP to domain name by appending “in-addr.arpa” to reversed IP.

     Example:
     ```
     IP: 132.34.45.121  
     Query: 121.45.34.132.in-addr.arpa
     ```
     – This query is processed by the inverse domain to find the corresponding host name.

  9. **Steps in DNS Lookup Process:**
     1. The user enters a domain name into the browser.
     2. Browser checks its cache.
     3. If not found, it queries the local DNS resolver.
     4. The resolver checks its cache; if not found, it queries higher-level DNS servers.
     5. Once resolved, the IP address is returned and stored in the cache.
     6. The browser uses this IP to establish a TCP connection with the web server.

• Example Program Logic (in Python):
  ```python
  import socket

  # Get IP from domain name
  domain = input("Enter domain name: ")
  print("IP Address:", socket.gethostbyname(domain))

  # Get domain name from IP
  ip = input("Enter IP address: ")
  print("Domain Name:", socket.gethostbyaddr(ip))
