open wireshark
search ssl or tls
find client hello packet just above server hello packet
right click on it 
follow
tls stream
close pop up
in search bar add && ssl infromt of that command itself

Title: Study of SSL Protocol by Capturing Packets using Wireshark  

• Problem Statement:
  – To study and analyze the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol by capturing packets in Wireshark while visiting an SSL-secured website such as a banking or e-commerce site.

• Aim:
  – To understand the working of SSL/TLS protocol and analyze encrypted communication between a client and server using the Wireshark tool.

• Tools Used:
  – Wireshark Network Analyzer Tool

• Concept Description:

  1. **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):**
     – SSL is an encryption-based Internet security protocol developed by Netscape in 1995.
     – It ensures **privacy, authentication, and data integrity** in communication between two systems.
     – SSL has been succeeded by **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**, which is its more secure version.
     – SSL/TLS encrypts data transmitted across the web, so anyone intercepting the traffic cannot read the actual content.

  2. **How SSL/TLS Works (Handshake Process):**
     The SSL handshake is the process by which the client (browser) and server establish a secure communication session.
     The steps are as follows:
     1. **Client Hello:** The client sends a message to the server with supported encryption algorithms and a random value.
     2. **Server Hello:** The server responds with the chosen encryption algorithm, its digital certificate (public key), and another random value.
     3. **Certificate Verification:** The client verifies the server’s digital certificate using a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
     4. **Key Exchange:** The client and server generate a session key using asymmetric encryption.
     5. **Encrypted Data Transfer:** After the handshake, all communication is encrypted using symmetric encryption with the session key.

  3. **Importance of SSL/TLS:**
     – Encrypts data to ensure confidentiality during transmission.
     – Authenticates the identity of websites (prevents fake site attacks).
     – Maintains data integrity by ensuring that transmitted data is not modified.
     – Protects sensitive user information such as passwords, credit card details, and personal data.

  4. **Ports Used:**
     – SSL/TLS runs over **TCP port 443** (used for HTTPS websites).
     – HTTP without SSL runs over port 80.

  5. **Wireshark Filters Used:**
     – The following display filters are used in Wireshark to analyze SSL traffic:
       ```
       tcp.port == 443
       tls
       tcp.stream eq 20
       tcp.stream eq 20 && tls
       ```
       **Explanation:**
       - `tcp.port == 443` → Displays all encrypted HTTPS (SSL/TLS) packets.
       - `tls` → Filters only packets using the TLS/SSL protocol.
       - `tcp.stream eq 20` → Displays packets of one specific TCP connection (stream number 20).
       - `tcp.stream eq 20 && tls` → Displays only SSL/TLS packets within that specific TCP stream, allowing detailed inspection of the handshake process.

  6. **Procedure:**
     1. Open Wireshark and start packet capture on the active network interface (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
     2. Open a browser and visit any HTTPS-secured website such as:
        – https://www.amazon.in  
        – https://www.icicibank.com  
        – https://www.flipkart.com
     3. Wait for a few seconds while packets are being exchanged between your system and the server.
     4. Stop packet capture in Wireshark.
     5. Apply filters:
        - Use `tcp.port == 443` or `tls` to view SSL/TLS traffic.
        - Identify packets showing “Client Hello,” “Server Hello,” “Certificate,” and “Application Data.”
     6. Observe the handshake process (encryption negotiation) and note the exchanged certificates and encrypted data packets.
     7. Save the capture file.

  7. **Observation:**
     – Wireshark displays several TLS packets, including:
       • **Client Hello:** Browser initiates SSL handshake.  
       • **Server Hello:** Server responds with its SSL certificate.  
       • **Certificate:** Contains server’s public key and identity details.  
       • **Change Cipher Spec:** Both sides switch to encrypted communication.  
       • **Encrypted Application Data:** Actual data exchanged in encrypted form.
     – The entire process ensures secure end-to-end communication between client and server.

  8. **Advantages of SSL/TLS:**
     – Provides encryption and prevents data interception.
     – Authenticates the website’s legitimacy.
     – Maintains data integrity and confidentiality.
     – Builds user trust for online services and payments.

  9. **Disadvantages:**
     – Requires SSL certificates which may have cost.
     – Slightly slower due to encryption/decryption overhead.

• Output:
  – Successfully captured and analyzed SSL/TLS packets in Wireshark.
  – Observed the “Client Hello,” “Server Hello,” “Certificate,” and “Encrypted Data” packets.
  – Verified that the communication occurred over TCP port 443.
