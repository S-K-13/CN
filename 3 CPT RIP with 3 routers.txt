Assignment No: 3
Title: Use Packet Tracer tool for configuration of 3-router networks using one of the following protocols: RIP/OSPF/BGP.

• Objective:
  – To configure multiple routers in a network using Cisco Packet Tracer.
  – To understand different routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, and BGP) and how they determine data paths between networks.

• Aim:
  – The main aim of this practical is to learn how routers exchange routing information to ensure data can be sent between networks.
  – To understand the functioning and configuration of dynamic routing protocols.

• Tools Used:
  – Cisco Packet Tracer Software
  – Routers, Switches, PCs (as end devices)
  – Cables: Copper straight-through and crossover cables

• Concept Description:
  – A router is a network device that connects multiple networks and forwards packets based on IP addresses.
  – **Routing** is the process of selecting paths in a network to send data from source to destination.
  – There are two types of routing:
      1. **Static Routing:** Routes are manually defined by the network administrator.
      2. **Dynamic Routing:** Routers automatically exchange route information using routing protocols.

• Routing Protocols Used:
  1. **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):**
     – RIP is one of the oldest distance-vector routing protocols.
     – It uses **hop count** as the routing metric (number of routers data passes through).
     – The maximum hop count is **15**, beyond which the destination is considered unreachable.
     – RIP updates routing tables every 30 seconds and prevents loops using hop limits.

  2. **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):**
     – OSPF is a **link-state routing protocol** that uses **Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm**.
     – It provides faster convergence and is suitable for large networks.
     – It divides a network into areas and exchanges topology information among routers.

  3. **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):**
     – BGP is used for routing between large networks or across the internet.
     – It is a **path-vector protocol**, used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to exchange routes between autonomous systems.

• Why We Perform This Practical:
  – To learn how routers communicate and share routing tables using dynamic routing protocols.
  – To understand how packets find their paths across multiple routers and networks.
  – To practically configure and verify routing between different subnets.

• Procedure Summary (Example Using RIP Protocol):
  1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
  2. Place three routers (Router0, Router1, Router2) and connect them using serial or Ethernet ports.
  3. Connect PCs to each router using switches and assign IP addresses according to the IP addressing table.
  4. Configure IP addresses for router interfaces (FastEthernet and Serial).
  5. Enable routing protocol RIP:
     Router(config)#router rip
     Router(config-router)#network 192.168.10.0
     Router(config-router)#network 10.0.0.0
  6. Repeat for all routers with respective network addresses.
  7. Verify connections using the “ping” command between PCs from different networks.

• Example Commands:
  Router0(config)#router rip
  Router0(config-router)#network 192.168.10.0
  Router0(config-router)#network 10.0.0.0

  Router1(config)#router rip
  Router1(config-router)#network 192.168.20.0
  Router1(config-router)#network 10.0.0.0
  Router1(config-router)#network 11.0.0.0

  Router2(config)#router rip
  Router2(config-router)#network 192.168.30.0
  Router2(config-router)#network 11.0.0.0

• Output:
  – All three routers successfully exchange routing information.
  – PCs connected to different routers can communicate with each other.
  – “Ping” command between PCs of different networks returns successful replies.

• Concept Used:
  – Dynamic Routing Protocols (RIP/OSPF/BGP)
  – IP Addressing and Subnetting
  – Router Configuration in Packet Tracer
  – Packet Forwarding and Verification using Ping

• Outcome:
  – Students learned to configure routers and enable communication across different networks.
  – Understood how routing tables are built and maintained using dynamic routing protocols.

• Conclusion:
  – We have successfully configured a 3-router network using the RIP protocol in Cisco Packet Tracer.
  – The experiment demonstrated how routers exchange routing information and forward packets efficiently between different networks.
