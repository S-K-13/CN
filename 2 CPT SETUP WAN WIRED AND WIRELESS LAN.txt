Assignment No: 2
Title: Setup a WAN which contains wired as well as wireless LAN by using a Packet Tracer tool and demonstrate the transfer of a packet from LAN 1 (wired LAN) to LAN 2 (wireless LAN).

• Objective:
  – To configure wired LAN and wireless LAN.
  – To configure an access point and connect both LANs via WAN.
  – To demonstrate data transfer between wired and wireless networks.

• Aim:
  – The main aim of this practical is to understand how a Wide Area Network (WAN) can connect multiple Local Area Networks (LANs) that use different connection types (wired and wireless).
  – To learn the configuration of network devices such as routers, switches, and access points in Cisco Packet Tracer.

• Tools Used:
  – Cisco Packet Tracer Software
  – Network devices: PCs, Switches, Routers, Access Points, and Wireless Devices
  – Cables: Copper straight-through and crossover cables

• Concept Description:
  1. **Wired LAN (Local Area Network):**
     – A wired LAN connects computers and other devices within a limited area using Ethernet cables (Cat 5e, Cat 6).
     – It provides high-speed, reliable, and secure communication.
     – Devices like switches and routers are used to manage data flow.

  2. **Wireless LAN (WLAN):**
     – A wireless LAN uses radio waves to connect devices to the network without physical cables.
     – It uses Wi-Fi technology and allows devices like laptops and mobile phones to connect freely within the network coverage area.
     – A Wireless Access Point (AP) acts as a bridge between wired and wireless segments.

  3. **WAN (Wide Area Network):**
     – A WAN connects multiple LANs located in different geographical locations.
     – It uses routers to forward data between networks.
     – WANs can span cities or even countries and rely on technologies like leased lines, fiber optics, and satellite links.
     – The Internet is the largest example of a WAN.

  4. **Access Point (AP):**
     – The access point allows wireless devices to connect to the wired LAN.
     – It transmits and receives data over Wi-Fi and extends the network range.

  5. **Router:**
     – A router connects multiple networks and directs data packets between them based on IP addresses.
     – It ensures that data from LAN 1 can reach LAN 2 through proper routing configuration.

• Why We Perform This Practical:
  – To learn how to connect and integrate wired and wireless LANs using a WAN connection.
  – To understand device roles like router, access point, and switch in establishing connectivity.
  – To practice configuring IP addresses and testing data transfer between networks.

• Procedure Summary:
  1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
  2. Create two LANs — one wired and one wireless.
  3. Use switches for wired LAN and an access point for wireless LAN.
  4. Connect both LANs through routers (WAN setup).
  5. Assign IP addresses to all devices properly.
  6. Configure access point settings (SSID, channel, etc.) for Wi-Fi.
  7. Use “ping” command or simulation to test packet transfer between LAN 1 and LAN 2.

• Output:
  – Successfully configured a WAN that connects both wired and wireless LANs.
  – Verified packet transfer between LAN 1 (wired) and LAN 2 (wireless) using the simulation mode in Packet Tracer.
  – The communication between both networks confirms correct routing and configuration.

• Outcome:
  – Students learned to configure wired and wireless LANs.
  – Understood how an access point and router enable inter-network communication.
  – Gained hands-on experience in WAN setup using Cisco Packet Tracer.

• Concept Used:
  – Network Topologies (Star, Extended Star)
  – IP Addressing and Subnetting
  – Router configuration and Access Point setup
  – Packet Simulation and Connectivity Testing

• Conclusion:
  – We have successfully set up a WAN that connects wired and wireless LANs using Cisco Packet Tracer.
  – The experiment demonstrated how routers and access points help integrate different network types for seamless communication.
