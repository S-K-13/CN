# Expanded 4–6 line explanations for ALL CN lab-manual concepts (18–22 topics)

1) Network Topologies  
Topologies define how nodes are interconnected and how data flows in a network.  
Bus uses a single backbone; failure on the main cable can stop the whole network.  
Star connects all devices to a central switch, giving high reliability but switch dependency.  
Mesh provides multiple redundant paths, good for fault tolerance but expensive.  
Tree/Hybrid mixes different topologies to balance cost and scalability.

2) Transmission Media (Guided & Unguided)  
Guided media (UTP, STP, Coax, Fiber) use physical cables for signal transmission.  
Fiber provides highest bandwidth and minimal noise, ideal for backbone links.  
Unguided media (Wi-Fi, Microwave, Infrared) transmit through air using radio frequencies.  
Each medium differs in distance support, speed, noise immunity and cost.  
Choice depends on environment, budget, and performance needs.

3) LAN / WLAN / WAN / Router / Access Point  
LAN covers small areas with wired Ethernet or Wi-Fi; low latency and high speed.  
WLAN allows wireless connectivity using APs, enabling mobility but introducing interference.  
WAN spans cities/countries using leased lines, MPLS, or satellite links.  
Routers forward packets between networks using routing tables and IP logic.  
APs connect wireless users to the wired backbone and manage Wi-Fi authentication.

4) Routing Protocols (RIP/OSPF/BGP, focus on RIP)  
Routing protocols help routers automatically discover paths to networks.  
RIP uses hop count as metric and broadcasts routing updates every 30 seconds.  
OSPF uses link-state advertisements and shortest-path (Dijkstra) algorithm.  
BGP manages routing between ISPs on the global internet using path-vector logic.  
In labs, RIP is used because it's simple to configure: router rip → network commands.

5) IP Addressing & Default Masks (Class A/B/C)  
IPv4 is 32-bit and divided into network + host portions.  
Classes determine default mask: A=255.0.0.0, B=255.255.0.0, C=255.255.255.0.  
Special ranges include loopback (127.x.x.x), private addresses (10.x, 172.16–31, 192.168.x).  
Correct addressing ensures proper routing and communication.  
Gateways must belong to the same network for hosts to reach external networks.

6) Subnetting & Subnet Masks  
Subnetting divides a large network into smaller logical networks by borrowing host bits.  
Each subnet has a network ID, broadcast address, and valid host range.  
Block size = 256 – mask_value, used to calculate subnet boundaries.  
Helps manage traffic, increase security, and avoid IP wastage.  
Essential for router configuration, VLANs, and hierarchical addressing.

7) Sockets & Socket Programming  
Sockets are endpoints for sending/receiving data between two network processes.  
TCP sockets provide reliable stream communication, while UDP sockets are faster but unreliable.  
Server performs: socket → bind → listen → accept → communicate.  
Client performs: socket → connect → communicate → close.  
Used for applications like chat servers, file transfer, and remote login tools.

8) TCP vs UDP  
TCP ensures reliable delivery using acknowledgments, retransmissions, and flow control.  
It establishes a connection via 3-way handshake and guarantees ordered, error-free data.  
UDP does not guarantee delivery, order, or reliability—making it lightweight.  
Used for DNS, gaming, VoIP, and streaming where latency matters more than accuracy.  
Both run on top of IP but serve different application requirements.

9) File Transfer using TCP/UDP  
TCP makes file transfer easy due to its reliable byte-stream nature.  
Sender reads file in chunks and sends; receiver reconstructs it sequentially.  
UDP requires manual handling of lost or out-of-order packets, often using sequence numbers.  
Used for custom file-sharing tools and multimedia transfer.  
Testing involves sending text, image, or small video files between client and server.

10) Wireshark Packet Capture Basics  
Wireshark records live packets and displays detailed protocol information.  
Capture filters limit packets at capture time; display filters refine after capture.  
Users analyze TCP handshakes, HTTP requests, ARP frames, DNS queries, etc.  
Statistics tools show conversations, throughput graphs, and protocol distribution.  
Used to study attacks, troubleshoot networks, and validate program behavior.

11) HTTP / HTTPS / FTP Concepts  
HTTP is a stateless protocol for fetching web content using GET/POST requests.  
HTTPS adds encryption using TLS, securing passwords and sensitive data.  
FTP uses separate control (port 21) and data channels for file upload/download.  
Wireshark shows clear HTTP messages but HTTPS content remains encrypted.  
Useful for analyzing login attempts, website loading behavior, and traffic patterns.

12) TCP Internals (Segment Format, Handshake, Flow Control)  
TCP segment has header fields like ports, sequence, acknowledgment, window, flags.  
Handshake: SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK establishes a reliable connection.  
Flow control uses sliding windows to prevent sender from overwhelming receiver.  
Congestion control (AIMD, slow-start) adapts speed based on network conditions.  
Important for understanding reliable transfer and performance behavior.

13) SSL / TLS (Structure & Purpose)  
TLS encrypts data between client and server using symmetric keys negotiated securely.  
Handshake includes ClientHello, ServerHello, certificate exchange, key generation.  
Ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data.  
Used in HTTPS, email security, VPNs and banking apps.  
In Wireshark, handshake messages are visible but actual data is encrypted.

14) DHCP (Scopes, Leasing, IP Assignment)  
DHCP automates IP distribution, reducing manual configuration errors.  
Server defines scope (pool), exclusions, gateway, DNS, and lease time.  
Client performs: Discover → Offer → Request → Acknowledgment.  
Ensures efficient address management in large networks like campuses.  
Packet Tracer simulations verify correct address allocation to multiple devices.

15) DNS (Name Resolution, Zones, Forward/Reverse Lookup)  
DNS converts user-friendly domain names into numerical IP addresses.  
Root, TLD, and authoritative servers form a hierarchical lookup structure.  
Forward lookup resolves name→IP, reverse lookup resolves IP→hostname.  
Caching improves speed and reduces DNS traffic.  
Essential for web browsing, email routing, and online services.

16) Packet Analysis Metrics & Reporting  
Metrics include packet count, bandwidth usage, TCP retransmissions, delays, etc.  
Flags like SYN/ACK/FIN help identify connection status or attack patterns.  
IO graphs visualize throughput and congestion over time.  
Protocol hierarchy shows distribution of HTTP/TCP/ARP/DNS traffic.  
Used in assignments to generate analysis reports from Wireshark captures.

17) Packet Tracer Configuration Workflow  
Start by placing end devices, switches, routers, and cables.  
Assign IP addresses and subnet masks to PCs and router interfaces.  
Configure routing (static or RIP) and any required services (HTTP, DHCP, FTP).  
Test connectivity using ping, simulation mode, and packet flow visualization.  
Save project and document results with screenshots.

18) Common Errors & Troubleshooting  
Wrong subnet masks cause hosts to be isolated from networks.  
Incorrect gateway prevents external communication outside local LAN.  
Wrong cable type or improper interface shutdown states block links.  
DNS misconfiguration causes websites to fail loading.  
Wireshark filters typed incorrectly lead to empty or misleading results.

19) TCP Flag Analysis (SYN, ACK, PSH, RST, FIN)  
SYN initializes a connection; ACK acknowledges received data.  
PSH asks the receiver to push data to the application immediately.  
RST terminates a connection abruptly, often due to errors.  
FIN closes a connection gracefully.  
Combination of flags helps identify attacks, resets, or abnormal behavior.

20) HTTP Packet Analysis (Requests, Responses, Headers)  
Inspect request lines (GET/POST), URLs, user-agent, cookies, host headers.  
Response shows status codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Error).  
Look into content-type, server type, caching rules.  
Useful for understanding how websites load resources.  
Captured using filter: http.

21) SSL Packet Analysis  
Only handshake messages visible—cipher suites, certificate chain, key exchange.  
No plaintext content visible after handshake.  
TLS versions (1.0–1.3) differ in handshake steps and security.  
Used for verifying if connection is encrypted correctly.  
Filter using: tls or ssl.

22) Client-Server Iterative/Concurrent Models  
Iterative server handles one client at a time; easy but slow for many clients.  
Concurrent server uses threads/processes to handle multiple clients simultaneously.  
TCP multi-client chat servers use concurrent approach.  
Used for assignments involving multiple connections from several PCs.  
Shows how real applications scale under load.
