Title: Study and Analyze the Performance of HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP Protocol using Packet Tracer Tool  

• Problem Statement:
  – To study and analyze the working and performance of the HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols using the Cisco Packet Tracer tool.  

• Aim:
  – To understand how different application layer protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP) function in a network and to compare their behavior and level of security.

• Tools Used:
  – Cisco Packet Tracer Software  

• Concept Description:

  1. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**
     – HTTP is an application-level protocol used for distributed and collaborative hypermedia information systems.
     – It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.
     – It uses **TCP port 80** for communication.
     – HTTP follows the **client-server model**, where:
       • The client (browser) sends a request to the server.
       • The server processes it and sends a response.
     – HTTP is a **stateless** and **connectionless** protocol.
       • Each request is independent — the server does not remember previous interactions.
     – HTTP allows transmission of multiple data types (HTML, images, videos, etc.) using MIME types.
     – Default behavior:
       – Connectionless: Disconnects after each response.
       – Stateless: No session memory.
       – Media Independent: Can transmit any type of data format.

  2. **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):**
     – HTTPS is the **secure version of HTTP**.
     – It provides encrypted communication between the browser and server using **SSL/TLS protocols**.
     – Uses **TCP port 443**.
     – HTTPS = HTTP + SSL/TLS Encryption.
     – It authenticates the server and ensures that transmitted data is encrypted, preventing interception by attackers.
     – Commonly used for:
       • Banking websites
       • E-commerce platforms
       • Login pages and confidential transactions

     **Advantages of HTTPS:**
     – Provides data encryption and integrity.
     – Protects against data theft and hacking.
     – Builds user trust and credibility.
     – Safe for online payments and login forms.

     **Disadvantages of HTTPS:**
     – Requires purchasing and installing an SSL certificate.
     – Slightly slower than HTTP due to encryption/decryption overhead.
     – Increased resource usage and maintenance cost.

  3. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):**
     – FTP is used to transfer files between a client and server over a network.
     – Uses **TCP ports 20 and 21**.
     – Operates in a **client-server model** where:
       • Client connects to an FTP server.
       • Files can be uploaded, downloaded, renamed, or deleted.
     – Supports two modes:
       • Active Mode – server initiates the data connection.
       • Passive Mode – client initiates the data connection.
     – Provides basic authentication using username and password.
     – Commonly used for:
       • Uploading website files to servers.
       • Transferring configuration files between network devices.

  4. **Practical Procedure in Packet Tracer:**
     1. Create a small network topology consisting of:
        – One **Server** (acting as HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP server).
        – One or more **PCs/Laptops** (as clients).
     2. Assign IP addresses to all devices (e.g., 192.168.1.x).
     3. Enable **HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP services** on the server (under “Services” tab).
     4. Configure the **Web Browser** on the client PC:
        – For HTTP: Enter `http://<server IP>`
        – For HTTPS: Enter `https://<server IP>`
     5. For FTP:
        – Open the Command Prompt on the PC.
        – Connect to the FTP server using:  
          `ftp <server IP>`
        – Login using default credentials (username: cisco, password: cisco).
        – Perform operations such as uploading or downloading files.
     6. Observe data transmission, request/response time, and encryption behavior for each protocol.
     7. Compare the performance of HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP in terms of speed, security, and reliability.

  5. **Working Principle:**
     – HTTP transmits data in plain text over TCP, making it faster but less secure.
     – HTTPS encrypts data using SSL/TLS, making it slower but more secure.
     – FTP allows authenticated file transfers between systems over TCP.

• Output/Observation:
  – Successfully configured HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP servers in Cisco Packet Tracer.
  – Verified the functionality of each protocol:
    • HTTP – Data transfer without encryption.
    • HTTPS – Secure and encrypted data communication.
    • FTP – File upload/download between client and server.
  – Analyzed and compared their working characteristics.

• Key Differences Observed:
  | Protocol | Port Used | Security | Data Transfer Type | Use Case |
  |-----------|------------|-----------|--------------------|-----------|
  | HTTP | 80 | Not Secure | Plain Text | Browsing, non-sensitive data |
  | HTTPS | 443 | Secure (SSL/TLS) | Encrypted | Banking, login pages |
  | FTP | 20, 21 | Basic Authentication | File Transfer | File upload/download |

• Outcome:
  – Understood how HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP function at the application layer.
  – Analyzed their performance, advantages, and limitations using Packet Tracer.

• Conclusion:
  – The performance and behavior of HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols were successfully analyzed.
  – HTTPS ensures secure communication compared to HTTP, while FTP enables efficient file transfers between systems.
